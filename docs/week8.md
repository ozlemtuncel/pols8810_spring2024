✔️ The goal of this week is to learn interaction terms. 

## Here are some key points:
- Interactions (or multiplicative term) are super common in the literature. They represent conditional relationships.
- In deciding whether to use interactions, you rely on theory (and that's it!).
- 3 things to remember when you are modelling interactions: (1) include all constitutive terms, (2) interpret things correctly, and (3) coefficient estimates are not the whole story!
- We cannot interpret the coefficient of the consecutive terms as unconditional effect! When we have $\beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_3$, interpreting $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ when we have a coefficient. (Like we do with OLS, one unit increase ...) Proof: partial derivative slides
- Depending on whether you have continuous or binary variable as constitutive term, your interpretation is going to change.
