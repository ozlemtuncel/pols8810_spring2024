✔️ The goal of this week is to learn matrix notation for OLS regression and get familiar with Gauss-Markov theorem. 

## Here are some key points:
- This is a math heavy week so prepare yourself. For this week, we are mostly interested in Gauss-Markov theorem, and we will go into details of assumptions next week. For this week, we have to blindly make some assumptions. 
- Our estimators $\hat{\beta_0}$ and $\hat{\beta_1}$ are random variables.
- Conflict data example: you have the whole population in Correlates of War (you know every conflict out there) and why you are using inferential statistics given that you have the question? Quick answer: parallel universe argument. Confused? [see here](https://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/298/docs/Graham_IR_211_Lecture_13_-_Art_of_Causal_Inference_2.pdf) and [here](https://medium.com/@ishi.sohani/prooving-the-parallel-universe-with-some-statistics-and-probability-5542b1a2bd64).
- Goal of the applied social science: explain some outcome with some set of variables. Can we really do that? NO. Humans are inpredictable. That's why things that we cannot explain systematically goes into the error term. 
- Alone, point estimates are useless. That's why we are mostly interested in the **variance**. We hope $E(\bar{x}) = \mu$. Thus, we are mostly interested in the precision of our estimates - this helps us to make meaningful inferences. And, we denote uncertainity using confidence intervals. 
- Gauss-Markov Theorem is the most important thing for this class -- we understand when we can use OLS regression and cannot use it. 
- Key assumptions we make:
  - X is fixed or non-stochastic/non-random (we will explain this later in detail and discuss how X can be fixed and random at the same time)
  - Y has both systematic and random/stochastic variation (randomness goes into the error term, and we assume error terms is i.i.d and normally distributed).
  - Two types of variation in Y: random and systematic -- one is perfectly fine (random) and the other one is worse (systematic).
  - i.i.d. = independently and identically distributed
  - N means normally distributed
  - $u_i \sim i.i.d. N(0, \sigma^2)$
  - $Var(Y|X\beta) = \sigma^2$ - stochastic (random) variation in Y
- Remember that $\sigma^2$ is population standard deviation
- Simply having more variation in our independent variable is going to lead to larger variation in our estimators. 
- Z score is the coefficient estimate divided by the standard error => higher z score, low p-value 
- If you have enough number of observations, you will get statistical significance. So, small number of sample size is bad, high number of sample size is meaningless.
- Best means minimum variance among other estimators.
