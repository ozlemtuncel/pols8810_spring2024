‚úîÔ∏è The goal of this week is to familiarize yourselves with basic probability theory and distributions. 

## Here are some key points:
- **Probability** is indicated either as 0 (zero, never happens) or 1 (one, always happens). 
- Percentages and probabilities are almost the same. 
- **Joint probability** is the probability of two or more things occuring together 
- **Statistical independence** indicates that the condition has no impact on the probability
- **Independence** occurs when one of event has no effect on the other event. Statistical independence and **mutual exclusivity** are two important concepts we are learning today.

## Some recommendations: 
-  Get familiarize with probability theory, set notation, and probability types. 
-  Learn to define p-value correctly!
-  If you need extra help in probability, [maybe this post](https://towardsdatascience.com/statistics-bootcamp-3-probably-probability-588a2640fc13) can help üßê
